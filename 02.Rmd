## The Challenge
Today, with our busy lives, finding the time to read has become a prominent challenge. From an online perspective, one study concluded that users read at most 28% of the words during an average visit [@nielsen_how_nodate]. Another study examined the time spent on every page and determined that 55% of users read five seconds or less [@read_55_2016]. With such lack of appetite for long readings, two third of Americans rely today on social media to getting their news [@wagner_two-thirds_2017]. While social media was able to deliver "fast" and "quick" information, sometimes in 140 characters or less, it lacks the depth and breadth. 

## How to Solve
There is a significant opportunity for a solution that can bridge between quality and time. This will be an excellent motivator for people who seek quality readings but have limited time to read.

The idea is to build an online tool that can process lengthy articles and extract the important words and sentences to generate a concise summary in few paragraphs. This tool will solve for "quality" and "time" and will be to provide a summarized version to read in relatively short time. This tool applies state of the art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to remove redundant and common English words and then determines important words based on the frequency of appearance. We assume that the important sentences will be the sentences where important words appeared.

## The Difference
This will be very useful for anyone seeking to acquire knowledge and information in short period. There will be no reason to turn away long articles or books.
