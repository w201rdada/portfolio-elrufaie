["CASHCAST.html", "1 Small Business Cash flow Forecast 1.1 A beginning. 1.2 A middle. 1.3 An end.", " 1 Small Business Cash flow Forecast Keywords cash flow, forecast, prediction 1.1 A beginning. A recent study from U.S. Bank found that 82% of small business fail in their first years due to poor cash flow mismanagement (Huls 2016). Small Businesses are entrepreneurs by nature; therefore cash management and day-to-day operations such as paying bills, depositing customer check are usually an afterhought. The complexity of managing their cash flow causes blurry visibility to the state and the health of their business, which becomes a burden in making decisions, such as hiring additional employees, expanding the business, or discontinuing a line of products, etc. Some of these decisions could seem trivial at the time, but they may be the tipping point for the business survival or failure. With data science, we can help small businesses by enlighten them about their cash forecast, predict a forecast and recommend actions to improve it. 1.2 A middle. This big idea provides a huge help for small businesses. It connects and aggregates all their cloud fingerprints, such as bank accounts, accounting solutions, inventory management solutions, to predict the future trends and patterns that could impact cash flow. Having such critical information centralized in one place allows the small business owners to gain a 4D sight to their business. Now at their fingertips, any small business owner can quickly know: how much cash is available in his bank account, how much he owes vendors, how much customers owe him, upcoming bills and potential revenue. The solution will rely on the following attributes to build an interactive tool that business owners can use to answer fundamental questions about their business and cash forecast: Cash In: how much cash they’ll be receiving, i.e someone to pay them. Cash Out: how much cash he needs pay, i.e paying a vendor, payroll. Upcoming Expenses: planned expenses, i.e property rental, car registration fees. The application will also be to recommend actions and decisions. For instance, when the application detects a potential financial impact, it will proactively alert and suggest a solution to the user. 1.3 An end. The solution will use these critical attributes to draw valuable insights for the small businesses to become more proactive, less vague about their business health and better business planners, which could easily be the reason for business survival. Now with such valuable information available at their fingertips, small business owners will have sound confidence in their decision and clear visibility to what is coming ahead. Now, take a moment and imagine a solution that can produce a recommendation similar to this: Your net income by mm/dd/yyyy will be $Y. I suggest you cut some of the operational expenses for the next few months References "],

For web surfers, one study concluded that people read at most 28% of the words during an average visit (NIELSEN 2018). Another study examined the time spent on every page and determined that 55% of users read five seconds or less (Read 2016). With such lack of appetite for long readings, two third of Americans rely today on social media to getting their news (Wagner 2017). While social media quickly became the new news agency and was able to deliver “fast” and “quick” information, sometimes in 140 characters or less, it lacks the depth and breadth that is required to digest complex topics. 2.2 Success = Time x Quality (NIELSEN 2018) study is very insightful and eye-opening. The study analyzed over 45K page views and concluded the following observations, including how such studies should be measured: People spend some of their time understanding the page layout and navigation features, as well as looking at the images, therefore eye-tracking studies would provide a more precise understanding of how users allocate their time on the web pages. There is a strong correlation between the number of words on a page and the time spends on those pages. On an average visit, users read half the information only on those pages with 111 words or less. There is a golden opportunity for a solution that can balance between time and quality. I believe there is a segment of users, who are hungry for quality readings but have limited time. The idea is an online tool that can process lengthy articles and extract the important words and sentences to generate a concise summary in few paragraphs. The success of this tool is the product of time and summary quality; therefore we’ll need to measure, test and experiment the quality continuously. Considering we have no control over the time variable, the quality is our path to success. 2.3 How will this work The output of the tool is a summarized version that can be read in relatively short time. This tool applies state of the art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to remove redundant and common English words and then determines important words based on the frequency of appearance. We assume that the important sentences will be the sentences where important words appeared. As previously said, the success of this tool is contingent upon the quality of the produced summary, i.e., is it too short to understand the topic? Is it too precise that essential information is excluded? Is it still very long? did the summary break the cohesiveness of the article? The success can be measured in multiple ways: Engagement Score: A formula that can be measured through various variables, such as how often existing users of the system use the tool and if their usage pattern is trending up. New User SignUp: A side-effect of the engagement score that can be measured by analyzing new users trend, which could be a result of the spread of word of mouth. Implicit Feedback: Measuring how long user session lasts. To support this, we need to build a predictive model of how long it should take to read the summary and compare that with the session of the user. If the session of the user was significantly less than the predictive range, then that is considered a detractor. Explicit Feedback: By randomly selecting users for NPS surveys. This will be a simple 1 to 10 rating that will be key to revise and tune the summary. NPS surveys are a great way to measure the value the tool is delivering to the users. A/B Experiment: Using different models to summarize long articles and picking the best model based on the collected implicit and explicit feedback. 2.4 The Difference Today there are several players in this space, smmry.com and freesummarizer.com to name few. What makes “Summarize This” different is two key elements: 1. The methodological and continuous model learning approach to improve the quality of the summary. 2. Unlike smmry.com and freesummarizer.com, Summarize This will be available as a browser plugin, so within any web page that you visit, you can simply click on the “Summarize This” plugin button, and you’ll be directed to a new window. For all the busy people, say goodbye to skimming! Summarize This is here for you! "]
