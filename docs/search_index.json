["CASHCAST.html", "1 Small Business Cash flow Forecast 1.1 A beginning. 1.2 A middle. 1.3 An end.", " 1 Small Business Cash flow Forecast Keywords cash flow, forecast, prediction 1.1 A beginning. A recent study from U.S. Bank found that 82% of small business fail in their first years due to poor cash flow mismanagement (Huls 2016). Small Businesses are entrepreneurs by nature; therefore cash management and day-to-day operations such as paying bills, depositing customer check are usually an afterhought. The complexity of managing their cash flow causes blurry visibility to the state and the health of their business, which becomes a burden in making decisions, such as hiring additional employees, expanding the business, or discontinuing a line of products, etc. Some of these decisions could seem trivial at the time, but they may be the tipping point for the business survival or failure. With data science, we can help small businesses by enlighten them about their cash forecast, predict a forecast and recommend actions to improve it. 1.2 A middle. This big idea provides a huge help for small businesses. It connects and aggregates all their cloud fingerprints, such as bank accounts, accounting solutions, inventory management solutions, to predict the future trends and patterns that could impact cash flow. Having such critical information centralized in one place allows the small business owners to gain a 4D sight to their business. Now at their fingertips, any small business owner can quickly know: how much cash is available in his bank account, how much he owes vendors, how much customers owe him, upcoming bills and potential revenue. The solution will rely on the following attributes to build an interactive tool that business owners can use to answer fundamental questions about their business and cash forecast: Cash In: how much cash they’ll be receiving, i.e someone to pay them. Cash Out: how much cash he needs pay, i.e paying a vendor, payroll. Upcoming Expenses: planned expenses, i.e property rental, car registration fees. The application will also be to recommend actions and decisions. For instance, when the application detects a potential financial impact, it will proactively alert and suggest a solution to the user. 1.3 An end. The solution will use these critical attributes to draw valuable insights for the small businesses to become more proactive, less vague about their business health and better business planners, which could easily be the reason for business survival. Now with such valuable information available at their fingertips, small business owners will have sound confidence in their decision and clear visibility to what is coming ahead. Now, take a moment and imagine a solution that can produce a recommendation similar to this: Your net income by mm/dd/yyyy will be $Y. I suggest you cut some of the operational expenses for the next few months References "],
["summarize-this.html", "2 Summarize This 2.1 The Challenge 2.2 How to Solve 2.3 The Difference", " 2 Summarize This Keywords summarize, abstract, save time 2.1 The Challenge Today, with our busy lives, finding the time to read has become a prominent challenge. From an online perspective, one study concluded that users read at most 28% of the words during an average visit (NIELSEN 2018). Another study examined the time spent on every page and determined that 55% of users read five seconds or less (Read 2016). With such lack of appetite for long readings, two third of Americans rely today on social media to getting their news (Wagner 2017). While social media was able to deliver “fast” and “quick” information, sometimes in 140 characters or less, it lacks the depth and breadth. 2.2 How to Solve There is a significant opportunity for a solution that can bridge between quality and time. This will be an excellent motivator for people who seek quality readings but have limited time to read. The idea is to build an online tool that can process lengthy articles and extract the important words and sentences to generate a concise summary in few paragraphs. This tool will solve for “quality” and “time” and will be to provide a summarized version to read in relatively short time. This tool applies state of the art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to remove redundant and common English words and then determines important words based on the frequency of appearance. We assume that the important sentences will be the sentences where important words appeared. The success of this tool is contingent upon the quality of the produced summary, i.e., is it too short to understand the topic? Is it too precise that essential information is excluded? Is it still very long? The success of this can be which can be measured in multiple ways: 1. Engagement Score: by measuring how often existing users use the tool and if their usage pattern is trending up. 2. New User SignUp: a side-effect of the engagement score that can be measured by analyzing new users trend, which could be a result of the spread of word of mouth. 2.3 The Difference This will be very useful for anyone seeking to acquire knowledge and information in short period. There will be no reason to turn away long articles or books. "]
